        <h1>Composition</h1>
        <p>Take a photo that relates to the following words: Line, Shape, Value, Colour, Texture, Mass/Volume, Space,
          Time, Motion</p>
        <!--ENTRY FOR LINE-->
        <h1 id="line">LINE</h1>
        <p>For the first in the list, I decided to go with an architecural theme. I believe that the majority of
          architectural buildings (modern or classic) implement straight lines not only because it is easier to build,
          but it is also simpler to make it look aesthetically pleasing (buildings with too many curves often look
          chaotic).</p>
        <h2>Before</h2>
        <div class="imageFlexBox"> <img src="resources/Week 1/Lines/lines_before.jpg" class="blogImage" alt="" /> </div>
        <h2>After</h2>
        <div class="imageFlexBox"> <img src="resources/Week 1/Lines/lines_dslr.jpg" class="blogImage" alt="" /> <img
            src="resources/Week 1/Lines/lines_after.jpg" class="blogImage" alt="" /> </div>
        <p>In the raw "after" photo (left) my goal was to improve on the composition and uniformity of the lines.
          Although it is not a requirement to keep the lines (relatively) parallel, I find that it is satisfying to see
          multiple large buildings in uniformity. The after photo (taken at the Barbican Estate, London) improved on
          the before photo in 2 major ways.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Uniform lines to create a sense of uniformity and unity between the buildings</li>
          <li>A minimalistic style in order to draw the viewer's attention to the subject (architecture) while still
            remaining within the theme of lines</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In terms of post-processing (right), I did not do much apart from slightly increase the contrast and
          decrease the saturation. I also used the lens correction tool in Lightroom to remove the slight bevel and
          vignette effect that the lens that I was using naturally produces. It was most important to remove the bevel
          effect to make sure the lines were straight, parallel and uniform in width.</p>
        <p>However, I believe the biggest failing of the after photo is that they are not as abstract as the before
          photo, which may have improved on the originallity of the the final image. This is because photos such as the
          after image are quite common and everyone has seen something like that, had it been more abstract, it would
          have drawn the viewer's attention even more.</p>
        <!--ENTRY FOR SHAPE-->
        <h1 id="shape">SHAPE</h1>
        <h2>Before</h2>
        <div class="imageFlexBox"> <img src="resources/Week 1/Shape/shape_before.jpg" class="blogImage" alt="" /> <img
            src="resources/Week 1/Shape/shape_before_thirds.jpg" class="blogImage" alt="" /> </div>
        <div class="imageFlexBox"> <img src="resources/Week 1/Shape/shape_before_chainrings.png" class="blogImage" alt="" />
        </div>
        <p>For the topic of shape, I wanted to explore circles. The bicycles outside Tower C were my focus in the
          "before" photo. I used the rule of thirds to compose my image and to make it look less messy. I achieved this
          to a certain extent, however the chainrings of the the two bikes do not line up in any particular way. Had I
          changed the angle of the photo so that only one chainring was visible it would have looked less cluttered.
          This being said, because there is no way to change the aperture on my phone the background also is very much
          in focus, I would have liked to blur the background slightly to draw the viewer's attention to the cirlces
          more. Had the background been a single colour (or a few complementary colours) I would not have needed to
          blur it, but this was out of my control as I could not move the bikes. My biggest failing in composing this
          shot was not checking if the line dividing the floor and the wall of the building were paralell to the
          horizontal, this would have been a very easy fix by just tilting the camera slightly.</p>
        <h2>After</h2>
        <div class="imageFlexBox"> <img src="resources/Week 1/Shape/shape_after.jpg" class="blogImage" alt="" /> <img
            src="resources/Week 1/Shape/shape_after_thirds.jpg" class="blogImage" alt="" /> </div>
        <p>This time the subject was a cast iron fence in the Baker Street area. This image improves on the prior in 3
          distinct ways.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Low F-stop to blur the background to declutter the shot</li>
          <li>Composition is greatly improved, the shot is almost uniform and the 2 lines on each side help focus the
            viewer on the centre of the image without cluttering the sides of the shot.</li>
          <li>The circles are lined up to each other in much more visually pleasing way.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>However, once again I forgot to line up the lines on the side to the vertical. This would have improved the
          quality of the image by creating unity between the subject at the shot. Another way I could have improved the
          shot was to move the camera slightly to the left in order to properly centre the background circle to the
          foreground circle, once again to create unity between the subject and the background.</p>
        <p>In conclusion, the after photo improved almost every aspect of the before picture by making the shot more
          uniform and decluttering the space. However, it would have been greatly improved had I taken more care of the
          alignment of the subject to the frame.</p>
        <!--ENTRY FOR VALUE-->
        <h1 id="value">VALUE</h1>
        <p>I wanted to use the Queen's head on the pound coin to emphasise the value of the monarchy.</p>
        <h2>Before</h2>
        <div class="imageFlexBox"><img src="resources/Week 1/Value/image_before.jpg" class="blogImage" alt="" /> </div>
        <p>I wanted to take a macro shot of the queens head in order to capture the scratches and metallic shine on the
          pound coin, however this proved to be difficult on a phone because the focal length was too far away and the
          resolution was most likely not high enough for the fidelity I wanted.</p>
        <h2>After</h2>
        <div class="imageFlexBox"><img src="resources/Week 1/Value/dslr.jpg" class="blogImage" alt="" /><img src="resources/Week 1/Value/dslr_after.jpg"
            class="blogImage" alt="" /></div>
        <p>Once I used my DSLR with a macro lens, I was able to achieve the composition I wanted. Previously I could
          not get a clear close head-on photograph with my phone because it always created a shadow. Once I used my
          dslr I could take a photo from a different angle at a much closer proximity in order to capture the fidelity
          of the impurities of the metal.</p>
        <p>I used lightroom to increased and decrease the highlights and shadows respectively in order to pull out more
          detail from the coin. (open the image in a new tab to see the full resolution)</p>
        <!--ENTRY FOR COLOUR-->
        <h1 id="colour">COLOUR</h1>
        <h2>Before</h2>
        <div class="imageFlexBox"> <img src="resources/Week 1/Colour/colour_before.jpg" class="blogImage" alt="" />
          <img src="resources/Week 1/Colour/colour_before_thirds.jpg" class="blogImage" alt="" /> </div>
        <p>For the topic of shape, I wanted to explore circles. The bicycles outside Tower C were my focus in the
          "before" photo. I used the rule of thirds to compose my image and to make it look less messy. I achieved this
          to a certain extent, however the chainrings of the the two bikes do not line up in any particular way. Had I
          changed the angle of the photo so that only one chainring was visible it would have looked less cluttered.
          This being said, because there is no way to change the aperture on my phone the background also is very much
          in focus, I would have liked to blur the background slightly to draw the viewer's attention to the cirlces
          more. Had the background been a single colour (or a few complementary colours) I would not have needed to
          blur it, but this was out of my control as I could not move the bikes. My biggest failing in composing this

        <h2>After</h2>
        <div class="imageFlexBox"> <img src="resources/Week 1/Colour/colour_dslr.jpg" class="blogImage" alt="" /> <img
            src="resources/Week 1/Colour/colour_after.jpg" class="blogImage" alt="" /> </div>
        <p>The rule of thirds grid below demonstraits the use of the lightroom lens correction feature. Depending on
          the lens, the shot comes out slightly beveled due to the curvature of the lens, by applying lens correction,
          the composition of the final image is true to how it looks through the viewfinder at the point of taking the
          shot; the composition of the image stays true to how I originally composed it.</p>
        <div class="imageFlexBox"> <img src="resources/Week 1/Colour/colour_dslr_thirds.jpg" class="blogImage" alt="" />
          <img src="resources/Week 1/Colour/colour_after_thirds.jpg" class="blogImage" alt="" /> </div>
        <h1>Texture</h1>
        <p>I wanted to explore the texture of liquids and how their surface looks when frozen in time.</p>
        <h2>Before</h2>
        <div class="imageFlexBox"> <img src="resources/Week 1/Texture/image_before.jpg" class="blogImage" alt="" /></div>
        <p>Arguably the worst photo I have taken, my phone did not have a shutter speed quick enough to capture the
          falling water and it ended up looking too blurry. I also had no tripod for my camera and therefore introduced
          some handheld shakiness into the photo, which becomes easier to see in low light photography.</p>
        <p>However, I believe this photo introduces the concept that I was going for well, even though the image itself
          is not very good.</p>
        <h2>After</h2>
        <div class="imageFlexBox"> <img src="resources/Week 1/Texture/dslr.jpg" class="blogImage" alt="" />
          <img src="resources/Week 1/Texture/dslr_after.jpg" class="blogImage" alt="" /> </div>
        <p>I found that the clear nature of water meant that I couldn't clearly capture the texture of the surface
          because you would see through it. Therefore, I decided to use milk and used a white background reduce
          contrast.</p>
        <p>I used a pitch black room and a dslr with a high shutter speed to capture the movement of the milk without
          blurring the image. The inbuilt flash was used although I would have perfered to have had an external one to
          reduce the shadow of the wine glass.</p>
        <p>In lightroom I increased and decreased the shadows and highlights respectively to increase contrast in the
          milk and show the texture of the surface better.</p>
        <h1>Mass/Volume</h1>
        <h2>Before</h2>
        <div class="imageFlexBox"> <img src="resources/Week 1/MassVolume/Mass, Volume Before.jpg" class="blogImage" alt="" /></div>
        <p>For this topic I wanted to use perspect to make something seem a lot larger than it actually is. By using a
          low perspective and composing the image so that the floor is not visible I could make it look like I was
          standing normally looking up at Ziishan. The use of the building in the background helps this illusion.</p>
        <h2>After</h2>
        <div class="imageFlexBox"> <img src="resources/Week 1/MassVolume/dslr.jpg" class="blogImage" alt="" /><img src="resources/Week 1/MassVolume/dslr_after.jpg"
            class="blogImage" alt="" /></div>
        <p>I wanted to compose an image with a similar concept, but without using a live subject. I wanted to go one step further in surrealism and use something even smaller.</p>
        <p>I used the same technique with the wooden hand, except I used had the hand on a table and used a mirror to reflect the room in the background. This is because in order to get the correct perspect the lens needs to be below the ground (previously I had done it by standing below Ziishan on the stairs)</p>
        <p>The problem with this photo is that the background is blurred because I was forced to use a lower f-stop because the image was too dark (I wasn't willing to turn the ISO). Had I used flash it would have darkened the background and had I brightened the room lights the hand would have been more silhouetted. Therefore, I had to compromise by using a smaller f-stop.</p>
        <p>Overall, I think the photo taken on the phone was better because the effect is more pronounced due to the higher light level.</p>
        <h1>Space</h1>
        <h2>Before</h2>
        <div class="imageFlexBox"> <img src="resources/Week 1/Space/Space Before.jpg" class="blogImage" alt="" /></div>
        <p>I liked the idea of frosted glass distorting the space behind it. I would have prefered to get closer to the
          glass and capture any imperfections it may have but my phone didn't have the focal length to focus on an
          object at a very close proximity.</p>
        <p>I wanted to come back and take the same photo with a dslr to compare how the space looks different between
          different devices.</p>
        <h2>After</h2>
        <div class="imageFlexBox"> <img src="resources/Week 1/Space/dslr.jpg" class="blogImage" alt="" />
          <img src="resources/Week 1/Space/dslr_after.jpg" class="blogImage" alt="" /> </div>
        <p>My original plan was to recreate the same image, however, I got inspire by my photo on texture to once again
          use white on white. This time I wanted to use white space created by the two sheets of paper and break it up
          with the tear down the middle.</p>
        <p>The photo initially was a little too dark and and some light vignetting on the sides (from my lens) which
          removed the white space effect. In lightroom I used lens corrections and turned the exposure up slightly to
          make the image lighter and to remove the vignetting.</p>
        <h1>Time</h1>
        <p>I found it difficult to think of an original idea for this concept, however, my idea was take a photo of a
          timepiece that not only displayed the time but was a relic of time too.</p>
        <h2>Before</h2>
        <div class="imageFlexBox"><img src="resources/Week 1/Time/Time Before.jpg" class="blogImage" alt="" /> </div>
        <p>I could not find an old clock while using my phone (around uni) however, I liked the idea of taking a photo
          of a digital clock on an oven. But I wanted to show as little of the oven as possible while still conveying
          the message that it's an oven. I wanted to play with how much I hide and have it still be recognisable.</p>
        <p>In retrospect, I could have composed this much better by enabling the rule of three grid on my phone.</p>
        <h2>After</h2>
        <div class="imageFlexBox"> <img src="resources/Week 1/Time/Time DSLR.jpg" class="blogImage" alt="" />
          <img src="resources/Week 1/Time/Time DSLR After.jpg" class="blogImage" alt="" /> </div>
        <p>Going back to my original concept I took a photo of an antique clock hanging over one of the roads in
          Marlebone, although it had some restoration done to it, according to a local shop owner it dated back 100-150
          years.</p>
        <p>I decided to also icorporate ideas from the before image and cut off the clock in the corner of the screen.
          Once again hiding the majority of the subject but still keeping it recognisable to the viewer. I then
          finalised the image in lightroom by decreasing the highlight and increasing the shadows in order to bring out
          more of the cracks and age on the face and wood of the clock.</p>
        <h1>Motion</h1>
        <h2>Before</h2>
        <div class="imageFlexBox"> <img src="resources/Week 1/Motion/fibonacci spiral.png" class="blogImage" alt="" />
          <img src="resources/Week 1/Motion/Motion Before.jpg" class="blogImage" alt="" /> </div>
        <p>At first I wanted to spin the camera lens so that it would create a fibonacci spiral swirl effect. Although
          the image turned out quite well, it required a lot of attempts because there was no reliable way of achieving
          the effect because I was spinning the phone by hand. This meant that it was very difficult to compose the
          shot because there was a very large margin of error.</p>
        <h2>After</h2>
        <p>One of the issues I encountered when switching to a DSLR, was that the lens was in the middle of the device,
          whereas on my phone the lens is at the top. This meant that I was not able to achieve the same effect,
          because when I would spin the DSLR, the swirl would originate from the centre of the screen and not the side,
          thus destroying the fibonacci composition I was aiming for.</p>
        <div class="imageFlexBox"> <img src="resources/Week 1/Motion/Motion DSLR.jpg" class="blogImage" alt="" />
          <img src="resources/Week 1/Motion/Motion DSLR After.jpg" class="blogImage" alt="" /> </div>
        <p>Alternatively, I decided to use a macro-lens to capture a subject's facial movements when they are speaking
          and to try to capture any micro-expressions that are shown.</p>
        <p>I thought this was an interesting idea because facial movement is often overlooked when interacting with
          someone. Although the human brain can process these subconsciously most people do not notice them.</p>
        <p>I thought it produced quite an intense and intimate image of the fast muscle reflexes we all have when
          displaying emotion or talking.</p>
