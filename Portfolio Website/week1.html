      <h1>Composition</h1>
      <p>Take a photo that relates to the following words: Line, Shape, Value, Colour, Texture, Mass/Volume, Space, Time, Motion</p>
      <!--ENTRY FOR LINE-->
      <h1 id="line">LINE</h1>
      <p>For the first in the list, I decided to go with an architecural theme. I believe that the majority of architectural buildings (modern or classic) implement straight lines not only because it is easier to build, but it is also simpler to make it look aesthetically pleasing (buildings with too many curves often look chaotic).</p>
      <h2>Before</h2>
      <div class="imageFlexBox"> <img src="resources/Week 1/Lines/lines_before.jpg" class="blogImage" alt=""/> </div>
      <h2>After</h2>
      <div class="imageFlexBox"> <img src="resources/Week 1/Lines/lines_dslr.jpg" class="blogImage" alt=""/> <img src="resources/Week 1/Lines/lines_after.jpg" class="blogImage" alt=""/> </div>
      <p>In the raw "after" photo (left) my goal was to improve on the composition and uniformity of the lines. Although it is not a requirement to keep the lines (relatively) parallel, I find that it is satisfying to see multiple large buildings in uniformity. The after photo (taken at the Barbican Estate, London) improved on the before photo in 2 major ways.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Uniform lines to create a sense of uniformity and unity between the buildings</li>
        <li>A minimalistic style in order to draw the viewer's attention to the subject (architecture) while still remaining within the theme of lines</li>
      </ul>
      <p>In terms of post-processing (right), I did not do much apart from slightly increase the contrast and decrease the saturation. I also used the lens correction tool in Lightroom to remove the slight bevel and vignette effect that the lens that I was using naturally produces. It was most important to remove the bevel effect to make sure the lines were straight, parallel and uniform in width.</p>
      <p>However, I believe the biggest failing of the after photo is that they are not as abstract as the before photo, which may have improved on the originallity of the the final image. This is because photos such as the after image are quite common and everyone has seen something like that, had it been more abstract, it would have drawn the viewer's attention even more.</p>
      <!--ENTRY FOR SHAPE-->
      <h1 id="shape">SHAPE</h1>
      <h2>Before</h2>
      <div class="imageFlexBox"> <img src="resources/Week 1/Shape/shape_before.jpg" class="blogImage" alt=""/> <img src="resources/Week 1/Shape/shape_before_thirds.jpg" class="blogImage" alt=""/> </div>
      <div class="imageFlexBox"> <img src="resources/Week 1/Shape/shape_before_chainrings.png" class="blogImage" alt=""/> </div>
      <p>For the topic of shape, I wanted to explore circles. The bicycles outside Tower C were my focus in the "before" photo. I used the rule of thirds to compose my image and to make it look less messy. I achieved this to a certain extent, however the chainrings of the the two bikes do not line up in any particular way. Had I changed the angle of the photo so that only one chainring was visible it would have looked less cluttered. This being said, because there is no way to change the aperture on my phone the background also is very much in focus, I would have liked to blur the background slightly to draw the viewer's attention to the cirlces more. Had the background been a single colour (or a few complementary colours) I would not have needed to blur it, but this was out of my control as I could not move the bikes. My biggest failing in composing this shot was not checking if the line dividing the floor and the wall of the building were paralell to the horizontal, this would have been a very easy fix by just tilting the camera slightly.</p>
      <h2>After</h2>
      <div class="imageFlexBox"> <img src="resources/Week 1/Shape/shape_after.jpg" class="blogImage" alt=""/> <img src="resources/Week 1/Shape/shape_after_thirds.jpg" class="blogImage" alt=""/> </div>
      <p>This time the subject was a cast iron fence in the Baker Street area. This image improves on the prior in 3 distinct ways.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Low F-stop to blur the background to declutter the shot</li>
        <li>Composition is greatly improved, the shot is almost uniform and the 2 lines on each side help focus the viewer on the centre of the image without cluttering the sides of the shot.</li>
        <li>The circles are lined up to each other in much more visually pleasing way.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>However, once again I forgot to line up the lines on the side to the vertical. This would have improved the quality of the image by creating unity between the subject at the shot. Another way I could have improved the shot was to move the camera slightly to the left in order to properly centre the background circle to the foreground circle, once again to create unity between the subject and the background.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, the after photo improved almost every aspect of the before picture by making the shot more uniform and decluttering the space. However, it would have been greatly improved had I taken more care of the alignment of the subject to the frame.</p>
      <!--ENTRY FOR VALUE-->
      <h1 id="value">VALUE</h1>

      <p>The rule of thirds grid below demonstraits the use of the lightroom lens correction feature. Depending on the lens, the shot comes out slightly beveled due to the curvature of the lens, by applying lens correction, the composition of the final image is true to how it looks through the viewfinder at the point of taking the shot; the composition of the image stays true to how I originally composed it.</p>
