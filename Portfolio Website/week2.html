      <h2>Exercise One</h2>
      <p>Listen to the two tracks and create a list of words that you relate to what you heard. Once you have both lists, pair words randomly and write down a third word that you relate to the pair</p>

      <p>The first track made me think of tribes and primitive civilisation, however the metalic noises also reminded me of robots or machines. From this I began to imagine an apocalypse style dystopia.</p>
      <p>The second track was lighter on the ears, which made it sound more civilised to me and the singing (?) in the background reminded me of the city Rapture from the Bioshock game franchise. However, it reminded me more of a space colony/city than an underwater city. I am not sure why, but this is what came into my head.</p>
      <p>From these two ideas I thought about a post-apocapalypse style dystopian desert covererd Earth where there are primitive tribes on the ground and the elite managed to escape the planet and live on a colony on another planet/moon/in space. This influenced me when I was thinking of the third words.</p>
      <h2>Exercise Two</h2>
      <p>Same as above, except words 1 and 2 are already given and paired.</p>

      <p>From this inspiration I wrote a short story</p>
      <h2>"Fractured"</h2>
      <p>The moonlight bounced off the side of the probe as it hovered over the desert. A lonely machine, destined to a life of solitude. The grey ball hovered about 1 metre off the ground, a variety of lights on its front blinked. It was quite smooth and unimpressive, save for a small camera which protruded from underneath it. After a while, a small red light came to life on its back and an antenna shot out. The small light at the end of the antenna blinked at regular intervals.</p>
      <p>A large computer screen filled with static sat in a dark room. Two people faced it. Neither spoke as the man in the chair typed on a keyboard. Once the sound of the keys had stopped, marked with a loud tap of the enter key and a slight flourish of his wrist, the static began to morph. They watched it with mild interest as the black and white camera feed from the probe flickered on display. The man in the chair began to nervously twitch his fingers. A manicured hand touched his shoulder in reassurance.</p>
      <p>Down there, the probe hummed into motion. Softly gliding over the sands. For miles, it flew through the wasteland. As the probe made its planned course, the ground became darker and piles of concrete, twisted metal and half melted rubber became more frequent. Over the flattened horizon a white building began to appear. The broken shards of glass that now littered the cracked concrete underneath glittered like diamonds.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Doing well so far. Command it to fly towards that&rdquo; said the commander as she pointed at the white building. The man in the chair typed on the keyboard. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know any buildings survived&hellip;&rdquo; muttered the man in a confused tone. He looked up at the woman for a response and after a pause she sternly replied, &ldquo;They didn&rsquo;t&rdquo;.</p>
      <p>The white structure grew as the probe advanced, the moonlight reflected off its rough surface. The probe began to slow down and came to a halt at the base of the structure.</p>
      <p>It was hard to make out any details in the video feed, the moonlight didn't help by illuminating the structure just enough to see it&rsquo;s outline and colour, but not enough for the camera to pick up a clear image. &ldquo;S-should I turn on the light?&rdquo; he stuttered nervously. The woman took her hand off his shoulder &ldquo;Your job, not mine. You decide. I&rsquo;m just here to make sure you don&rsquo;t lose your probe on the first flight rookie&rdquo;. The man reluctantly typed on his keyboard and paused as his finger quivered over the enter key. A bead of sweat rolled down his temple as he pressed down, his clammy finger slid across the key leaving a shiny trail as he slowly lifted his hand. His wide eyes fixed on the screen, his breath momentarily escaped him as he took in what he saw.</p>
      <p>A pyramid of bones towered high. Skulls, ribs and limbs of varying shades of grey and white split the landscape like a hellish obelisk. The heads of the dead laid there with open mouths, their muted laughs mocking him. After a few seconds of deafening silence the skulls began to scream, filling the air with an almost demonic sound.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON?!&rdquo; The man began to panic as he franticly typed on his keyboard. The probe did nothing. The video feed began to shake, rocks and other debris could be seen flying towards the probe. &ldquo;If you panic, you will misspell commands and the probe will reject your communications&rdquo; The woman started to get visibly agitated as even more debris flew towards the camera.</p>
      <p>The probe remained relatively stationary, swinging back every time a rock knocked it out of place. Figures begin to stand up from behind the obelisk, screaming as they threw their missiles. Painted and scarred bodies of men, women and children adorned with bones emerged into the light, faces twisted in anger as they reacted to the disturbance of their shrine.</p>
      <p>His fingers laid frozen across the keyboard as he watched what he saw. His superior slammed her open palm onto the table &ldquo;WELL FUCKING DO SOMETHING THEN!&rdquo; Her voice broke through his petrification and he quickly typed with regained energy into his keyboard. His fear of his commander trumped his phobia of the wasteland. The room was plunged into darkness for a couple seconds and the static faded back on screen. &ldquo;That was a disaster&rdquo; she muttered, seemingly indifferent to what just happened. &ldquo;At least you can see why we haven&rsquo;t returned to the planet.&rdquo;. The man gave a nervous laugh in reply. She continued, &ldquo;Your training taught you that they are sub-human, but they are just like us. At least they used to be...&rdquo; She patted his shoulder &ldquo;centuries of living in that irradiated wasteland will turn even the best of us into drooling savages&rdquo;.</p>
      <p>A few seconds earlier on Earth, just as the man switched the probe to autopilot, the camera and antenna retracted back into the sphere and it shot towards space. Leaving the wastelanders screeching and throwing rocks into the sky. The probe kept rising above the arid wasteland, picking up speed. The outline of the once rich river Thames faded through the desert like a forgotten memory, and the probe returned home.</p>
