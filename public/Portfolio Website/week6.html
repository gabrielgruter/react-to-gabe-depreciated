        <h1>Semiology &amp; Design</h1>
        <p>Create a poster that conveys a message without the use of words that directly explain the meaning.</p>
        <h2>IDEA</h2>
        <p>I wanted to convey the idea of Facebook and social media slowly killing the population. And because using
          social media is a decision made by the user I would relate it to suicide.<br> There are many posters that
          convey a similar message so I wanted to distinguish mine from others. The message would not only be aimed at
          users of social media, but the person seeing the poster too.</p>
        <p>Many users of Facebook (for example) share posters that are anti-Facebook without noticing the irony. My
          poster would be aimed directly at the person reading the poster as well as the general population.</p>
        <div class="imageFlexBox"> <img src="resources/Week 6/Suicide.jpg" class="blogImage" alt="" /> </div>
        <p>The imagery of a silhouetted character shooting themselves in the head works well in this case because the
          Facebook logo can be manipulated to look like a gun in the hands of a suicidal person.</p>
        <h2>Conception</h2>
        <p>I used two references to create the silhouettes of the person and the hand holding the gun.</p>
        <div class="imageFlexBox">
          <img src="resources/Week 6/Sill.jpg" class="blogImage" alt="" />
          <img src="resources/Week 6/Gun.jpg" class="blogImage" alt="" />
        </div>
        <p>I then composited them together, added the Facebook logo, blood splatter and added text.</p>
        <h2>Final Versions</h2>
        <div class="imageFlexBox">
          <img src="resources/Week 6/poster1.png" class="blogImage" style="height: 25vw; width: 16.65vw;" alt="" />
          <img src="resources/Week 6/poster2.png" class="blogImage" style="height: 25vw; width: 16.65vw;" alt="" />
          <img src="resources/Week 6/poster3.png" class="blogImage" style="height: 25vw; width: 16.65vw;" alt="" />
        </div>
        <p>The three final versions that I had to choose from all conveyed a similar message. However, final choice was
          the center poster</p>
        <p>The left most poster did not convey to the reader that the message also applied to themselves and I did not
          think the colours flowed well. The black contrasts too much with the rest of the poster and draws the
          reader's eyes straight to the person and not the text at the top of the screen.</p>
        <p>The right most poster changes the black to dark blue and uses the complementary orange colour to give more
          movement to the gunshot and to emphasise the word "You" to the reader to signify that they are also the
          subjects of the message. However, the orange is used too much when it comes to the hair, as the orange was
          meant to compliment the blue and not overtake it on page.</p>
        <p>The final (middle) poster takes the positives of the previous two and removes the negatives. Although it is
          far from perfect, it embodies the message and the colours interact with each other in a pleasant way.</p>
        <h2>Extras</h2>
        <p>As an extra I wanted to experiment how Semiology can be used to convey a different message with the same
          symbol.</p>
        <p>Silhouettes are extremely versatile and can be used to convey countless of messages. By making very small
          changes such as background colour, text and the item being used, the poster can be completely transformed and
          convey a completely different idea.</p>
