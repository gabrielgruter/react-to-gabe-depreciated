# 404 Error!
## You shouldn't really be here...
But now that you are let me tell you that I think 404 pages are neglected.  
404 pages can be frustrating for the user, but with the correct design (and a little bit of comedy) they can become tolerable and not detract from the experience.
  
Just a thought :)  
Now please, return back to my website or check out my CV while your here? ;)
